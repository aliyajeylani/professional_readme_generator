# Description
  This week's project is to generate as readme file using node inquirer in order to run a command line application that accepts user inputs. My application will prompt the user for information about their project that will encompass all of the elements needed (title, description, installation, usage, credits, tests and license) in order to generate a professional ReadME file. 

  Here's a link of an example README generated by my application: https://github.com/aliyajeylani/professional_readme_generator/blob/main/READMETEST.md

  Here's a demo link that demonstrates the functionality of the application: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rGNjNo4OUdLZRgpyQ6H6_VZ1Hb-J_Lv9/view?usp=sharingLinks to an external site.
